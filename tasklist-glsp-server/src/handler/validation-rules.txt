Entity rules:
    - Entity not connected to anything.
    - Entity connected to another entity.
    - Entity not connected to a relation.
    - Entity connected to a relation without a weighted edge.
    - Entity not connected to an atribute.
    - Entity not connected to a key attribute but has attributes.

Weak entity rules:
    - Weak entity not connected to anything.
    - Must be connected to an existence dependent relation or an identifying dependent relation with a weighted edge.
    - Must be connected to a normal entity through an existence or identifying dependent relation.
    - If is connected to an existence relation must have a primary key.
    - If is connected to an identifying relation cant have a primary key.

Relation rules:
    - Relation not connected to anything.
    - Relation connected to another relation.
    - Relation not connected with weighted edges.
    - Relation connected with key attribute.
    - Relation connected with a weighted edge to an attribute.

Attribute rules:
    - Attribute not connected to anything.
    - Attribute can only be connected to the same type of attribute or an optional attribute (composite attribute).
    - If attribute is connected to other attributes it must be connected to an entity. 
    - Attribute can be connected only to normal relations.
    - Attribute can't be connected to a weighted edge.

Composite Attribute:
    - Can't have a key attribute in a composite attribute.
    - Can't have a multi-valued attribute in a composite attribute.
    - Can't have a derived attribute in a composite attribute.
    - Can have an optional or a normal attribute in a composite attribute.

Derived attribute:
    - Derived attribute not connected to anything.
    - Derived attribute can be connected to another entity, relation, weak entity.
    - Derived attribute can't be connected to a weighted edge.

Key attribute:
    - Key attribute not connected to anything.
    - Key attribute can be connected to another entity.
    - Key attribute can be composed with other normal attributes or optional attributes.
    - Key attribute can't be connected to a weighted edge.

Multi-valued attribute:
    - Multi-valued attribute not connected to anything.
    - Multi-valued attribute can be connected to another entity, weak entity.
    - Multi-valued attribute can't be connected to a weighted edge.
