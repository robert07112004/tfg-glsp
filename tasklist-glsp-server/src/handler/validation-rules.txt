Entity rules: done                                      
    - Entity not connected to anything.
    - Relations:
        - If entity connected to relation, must have key attribute.
        - If has relations, they can only be connected with weighted edges.
    - Specializations:
        - If entity connected to specialization and is a superclass, it must have key attribute.
        - If has specializations, they can only be connected with transitions.
    - If has attributes, they can only be connected with: transitions and optional links.

Weak entity rules: done
    - Weak entity not connected to anything.
    - Must be connected to an existence dependent relation OR an identifying dependent relation.
    - Logic for Keys vs Relation types:
        - Existence Dependent -> Must have a Primary Key.
        - Identifying Dependent -> Cannot have a Primary Key.
    - Specializations:
        - Cannot be a child (Subclass) of a specialization.
        - Can be a parent (Superclass) of a specialization.
        - Must be connected with transitions (DEFAULT_EDGE_TYPE).
    - Attributes:
        - Must be connected with transitions or optional links.
    - Relations:
        - Must be connected with weighted edges.

Relation rules: done
    - Relation not connected to anything.
    - Relation connected to another relation.
    - Relation not connected with weighted edges.
    - Relation connected with key attribute.
    - Relation connected with a weighted edge to an attribute.

Existence dependence relation: done
    - Existence dependence relation not connected to anything.
    - Existence dependence relation must be connected to one entity and one weak entity with weighted edges.
    - Existence dependence relation can't be connected to attributes with weighted edges.
    - Existence dependence can't be connected to key attributes.

Identifying dependence relation: done
    - Identifying dependence relation not connected to anything.
    - Identifying dependence relation must be connected to one entity and one weak entity with weighted edges.
    - Identifying dependence relation must be connected to a key attribute with a transition.
    - Existence dependence relation can't be connected to attributes with weighted edges.

Attribute rules: done
    - Attribute not connected to anything.
    - Edges: Only Transitions (Default) or Optional Links. NEVER Weighted edges.
    - Valid Connections (Owners/Children):
        - Entities (Strong/Weak).
        - Relations (Any type).
        - Specializations (Triangles).
    - Prohibited Connections:
        - KEY Attributes (Primary/Alternative).
    - Attribute can't be connected through other attributes to more than one Entities/Relations/Specializations.
    - Ambiguity: Prevents an attribute from connecting "Entity A --(attribute)-- Entity B".

Key attribute: done
    - Key attribute not connected to anything.
    - Prohibited connections:
        - ONLY transitions.
    - Valid connections:
        - Entities (Strong/Weak).
        - Identifying dependence relations.
    - Key attributes can't have children (NO composite attributes).
    - Ambiguity: Prevents an attribute from connecting "Entity A --(attribute)-- Entity B".

Alternative key attribute:

Derived attribute: done
    - Derived attribute not connected to anything.
    - Derived attribute can be connected to another entity, relation, weak entity, specialization. But can't be connected to dependencies.
    - Derived attribute can't be connected to a weighted edge.
    - The names of attributes in the equation label has to match with the attributes that are connected to the same entity. 

Multi-valued attribute: done
    - Multi-valued attribute not connected to anything.
