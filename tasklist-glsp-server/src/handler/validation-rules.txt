Entity rules: done                                      
    - Entity not connected to anything.
    - Relations:
        - If entity connected to relation, must have key attribute.
        - If has relations, they can only be connected with weighted edges.
    - Specializations:
        - If entity connected to specialization and is a superclass, it must have key attribute.
        - If has specializations, they can only be connected with transitions.
    - If has attributes, they can only be connected with: transitions and optional links.

Weak entity rules: done
    - Weak entity not connected to anything.
    - Must be connected to an existence dependent relation OR an identifying dependent relation.
    - Logic for Keys vs Relation types:
        - Existence Dependent -> Must have a Primary Key.
        - Identifying Dependent -> Cannot have a Primary Key.
    - Specializations:
        - Cannot be a child (Subclass) of a specialization.
        - Can be a parent (Superclass) of a specialization.
        - Must be connected with transitions (DEFAULT_EDGE_TYPE).
    - Attributes:
        - Must be connected with transitions or optional links.
    - Relations:
        - Must be connected with weighted edges.

Relation rules: done
    - Relation not connected to anything.
    - Prohibited connections:
        - Transitions and optional links aren't allowed.
    - Valid connections:
        - Entities (Strong).
        - Attributes (Normal/Derived).
    - Relations must be connected with at least two entities.
    - Relations can't be connected with specializations, dependencies and other relations.

Existence dependence relation: done
    - Existence dependence relation not connected to anything.

        - Transitions and optional links aren't allowed.
    - Valid connections:
        - Entities (Strong/Weak).
    - Existence dependence relation can't be connected to attributes, relations, other dependencies and specializations.
    - Existence dependence relation must be connected to an entity and a weak entity. 

Identifying dependence relation: done
    - Identifying dependence relation not connected to anything.
    - Identifying dependence relation must be connected to one entity and one weak entity with weighted edges.
