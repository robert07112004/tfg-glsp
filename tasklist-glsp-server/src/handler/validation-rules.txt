Entity rules: done                                      
    - Entity not connected to anything.
    - Relations:
        - If entity connected to relation, must have key attribute.
        - If has relations, they can only be connected with weighted edges.
    - Specializations:
        - If entity connected to specialization and is a superclass, it must have key attribute.
        - If has specializations, they can only be connected with transitions.
    - If has attributes, they can only be connected with: transitions and optional links.

Weak entity rules: done
    - Weak entity not connected to anything.
    - Must be connected to an existence dependent relation OR an identifying dependent relation.
    - Logic for Keys vs Relation types:
        - Existence Dependent -> Must have a Primary Key.
        - Identifying Dependent -> Cannot have a Primary Key.

        - Cannot be a child (Subclass) of a specialization.
        - Can be a parent (Superclass) of a specialization.
        - Must be connected with transitions (DEFAULT_EDGE_TYPE).
    - Attributes:
        - Must be connected with transitions or optional links.
    - Relations:
        - Must be connected with weighted edges.

Relation rules: done
    - Relation not connected to anything.
    - Relation connected to another relation.
