Entity rules: done                                      
    - Entity not connected to anything.
    - Relations:
        - If entity connected to relation, must have key attribute.
        - If has relations, they can only be connected with weighted edges.
    - Specializations:
        - If entity connected to specialization and is a superclass, it must have key attribute.
        - If has specializations, they can only be connected with transitions.
    - If has attributes, they can only be connected with: transitions and optional links.
